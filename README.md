# BKTR

## Intro
This project is a *R* implementation of the BKTR algorithm presented by Mengying Lei, Aur√©lie Labbe & Lijun Sun (2023).
The article presenting the algorithm can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00046).

BKTR stands for Scalable Spatiotemporally Varying Coefficient Modelling with Bayesian Kernelized Tensor Regression.
It allows to model spatiotemporally varying coefficients using a Bayesian framework.
We implemented the algorithm and more in a *R* package that uses [torch](https://torch.mlverse.org/) as a tensor operation backend.

For information, an alternative *Python* implementation of the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/julien-hec/pyBKTR).
The *Python* implementation is synchronized with this repository and development is done in parallel.
The synchronization of features will be done at a subrevision level (x.y.0).

An article presenting the *R* package in details is currently in preparation and should be available soon.

## Installation

### CRAN Installation
```r
install.packages("BKTR")
```

### Latest Development Version Installation
The latest development version on GitHub can be installed using the `devtools` package:
```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("julien-hec/BKTR", ref = "main")
```

**NOTE**

Installing torch can be straightforward on some systems and more complicated on others. Please refer to the [torch GitHub repo issues](https://github.com/mlverse/torch/issues) if you encounter any problems regarding its installation.

## Simple Example
To verify that everything is running smoothly you can try to run a BKTR regression on the BIXI data presented in the package. (The data is already preloaded in the package via the `BixiData` [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Introduction.html) class).

The following code will run a BKTR regression using sensible defaults on the BIXI data and print a summary of the results.
```r
library(BKTR)
bixi_data <- BixiData$new()
bktr_regressor <- BKTRRegressor$new(
    data_df=bixi_data$data_df,
    spatial_positions_df=bixi_data$spatial_positions_df,
    temporal_positions_df=bixi_data$temporal_positions_df,
    burn_in_iter=50,
    sampling_iter=50
)
bktr_regressor$mcmc_sampling()
summary(bktr_regressor)
```
